# Background

Yesterday I got challanged from big transportation company in Indonesia for Frontend Developer position. The test were done on Algobash. The challange was complete all functionalities for an application contained Users Table. I felt stupid during technical testðŸ˜–, because I failed. I have ever develop application like this but I got nervous and it made my brain freezeðŸ¥¶. Because I felt annoyed I decided to develop the test again from the scratch.
